# GROMACS-Tutorial-and-Installer
This repository is for a live tutorial for installing GROMACS and running a simple ionic liquid simulation using Agilio Padua's "ILFF" (Ionic Liquid Force Field)
This tutorial assumes that you have access to a computer with a Linux operating system (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

If you have a Linux machine with root access, you can use prerequisites.sh by calling "sh prerequisites.sh".
If you have a Linux machine without root access, you can use prerequisites-noroot.sh by calling "sh prerequisites-noroot.sh"

Once you have installed GROMACS, you can follow along live time with the tutorial on Zoom, but you can also use the prepare-files.sh script to create the input files needed to run the simulation instead of creating the files manually step by step.
